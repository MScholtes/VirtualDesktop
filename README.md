# VirtualDesktop
V1.4.2, 2019-12-13

C# command line tool to manage virtual desktops in Windows 10<br><br>
(look for a powershell version here: https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/Powershell-commands-to-d0e79cc5)

**With Windows 10 1809 Microsoft changed the API (COM GUIDs) for accessing the functions for virtual desktops again. I provide three versions of virtualdesktop.cs now: virtualdesktop.cs is for Windows 10 1809 and newer, virtualdesktop1803.cs is for Windows 10 1803, virtualdesktop1607.cs is for Windows 10 1607 to 1709 and Windows Server 2016. Using Compile.bat all executables  will be generated (thanks to [mzomparelli](https://github.com/mzomparelli/zVirtualDesktop/wiki) for investigating).**

## Generate:
Compile with Compile.bat (no visual studio needed, but obviously Windows 10)

## Description:
Command line tool to manage the virtual desktops of Windows 10.
Parameters can be given as a sequence of commands. The result - most of the times the number of the processed desktop - can be used as input for the next parameter. The result of the last command is returned as error level.
Virtual desktop numbers start with 0.
