VirtualDesktop

C# command line tool to manage virtual desktops in Windows 10 and Windows 11

Version 1.21, 2025-08-11
- bugfix: simultaneous calls of animated switch function no longer cause Windows Explorer to crash

(look for a powershell version here:
https://github.com/MScholtes/PSVirtualDesktop
or here:
https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/VirtualDesktop)


With Windows 11 23H2 Release 3085 Microsoft did change the API (COM GUIDs) for 
accessing the functions for virtual desktops again. I provide five versions of 
virtualdesktop.cs now: virtualdesktop.cs is for Windows 10, virtualdesktop11.cs 
is for Windows 11, virtualdesktop11-24h2.cs for Windows 11 24H2, 
virtualdesktopserver2022.cs is for Windows Server 2022, 
virtualdesktopserver2016.cs is for Windows Server 2016. Using Compile.bat all 
executables will be generated.

Generate:
 Compile with Compile.bat (no visual studio needed, but obviously Windows 10 or 11)

Description:
 Command line tool to manage the virtual desktops of Windows 10 and 11.
 Parameters can be given as a sequence of commands. The result - most of
 thetimes the number of the processed desktop - can be used as input for the
 next parameter. The result of the last command is returned as error level.
 Virtual desktop numbers start with 0.

Hint: Insert ^^ somewhere in window title parameters to prevent finding the own window. ^ is removed before searching window titles.
